# Dice Race to 50 ðŸ¥³ - README

## Overview
Dice Race to 50 is a simple yet exciting Python-based game designed for 2 to 4 players. Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided dice, aiming to be the first to accumulate a total score of 50. The game combines elements of luck, risk management, and strategy, making it an engaging activity for friends and family.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
No additional installation is required, as the game uses the standard Python library.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Run the script in your Python environment.
2. **Select Number of Players**: Input the number of players (between 2 to 4).
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns to roll the dice.
   - If a player rolls a '1', their turn ends, and they score zero points for that round.
   - If a player rolls any other number (2-6), they can choose to roll again or end their turn. The rolled number is added to their score for that turn.
   - Players can keep rolling to accumulate more points, but risk rolling a '1' which would reset their score for that turn.
4. **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins the game.

## Game Rules
- The game is turn-based, with each player having a chance to roll the dice per turn.
- Rolling a '1' resets the score for the current turn and ends the playerâ€™s turn.
- Players can choose to end their turn after each roll to save their current turn score.
- The game continues until a player reaches or exceeds a score of 50.

## Customization
You can modify the `max_score` variable in the script to set a different target score.
